# Erick Saavedra

<div align="justify">

Following my passion of being able to combine hardware and software, I am currently participating in a coding bootcamp in Lima, Peru, which focuses on both the front-end and back-end of programming; the main objective of taking part in this bootcamp is to begin new career as a full-stack developer. Part of my objective is to create fast and scalable solutions which can be maintained through time, focusing on the issue at hand and how to best solve it.

I am not only a reliable and trustworthy person, but I also love to talk and discuss, with a lot of passion, about anything technology-related.

Some of my capabilities and interests include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Git and Github.

_Thank you for reading my resume. If you want to contact me, Please send me an email._
